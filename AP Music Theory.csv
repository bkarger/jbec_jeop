Every truly cultured music student knows
Bring the music ringing from your chest
While you sing your scales and your arpeggios
"twice as fast as the notation dictates (twice as fast as the key signature, so if it's notated 4/4, it's really 2/2)"
"range of a vocal part, also can be the range an instrument is capable of playing"
an extended solo section for improvisational work in a piece
"progressing by intervals of a second, scale-wise motion"
"progressing by intervals large than a second, step-wise motion"
"two or more harmonically independent melodies, polyphonic technique, ex. fugue, canon, etc."
"exposition, development and recapitulation"
ABACADAEAF... always returns to A theme
similar rhythmic material in all parts
most important melodic line
melodic lines not equal in significance to the primary melody
"secondary melody that is similar in contour with a primary melody, often maintain a constant interval relationship"
either sustained tones or chords or a repeated melodic rhythmic figure which accompanies the melody
"like a coda, only smaller"
musical situation that overlaps or coincides with the next pattern
persistent motif or phrase repeated in the same voice
"typically two groups of three beats replaced by three groups of two beats (something that feels like it's in two, when the time signature is in three)"
leap in the same direction by the outer voices (bass and soprano) to an octave (or perfect fifth)
scale of eight pitches alternating whole and half steps
I 6/4 chord precedes a I V cadence. Sounds a lot like V V I
"temporary changing of the key, indicated with two chords - the first is the chord and the second is the key it's in. V / IV would be the V chord in the key of the IV chord."
