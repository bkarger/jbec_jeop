**The final report should not exceed 1,500 words. You should aim for no more than three figures and tables.**


# Part I

## Research question: 
What is the most difficult school subject according to Jeopardy?



## Introduction: 
Why did you decide to ask this question?



## Methods: 
How did you investigate the data to try to answer your question? This should not include R code (save that for the tutorial part), but rather should use language like “To determine if … was associated with …, we measured the correlation …”. It’s fine for this project if the Methods are fairly simple (“We investigated the distribution of … using boxplots …”, “We took the mean and interquartile range of …”, “We mapped state-level averages of …”, etc.). Why do you choose to use the Methods you used? Why do you think they’re appropriate and useful for your project?




## Results: 
What did you find out? Most of these slides should be figures or tables. Discuss your interpretation of your results as you present them. Ideally, you should be able to show your main results in about 3 slides, with one figure or table per slide.



## Conclusions: 
So what? How do your results compare with what other people have found out about your research question? Based on what you found, are there now other things you want to check out?





# Part II: Tutorial

Overview of your approach in R: Step us through a condensed version of how you did your project




## Interesting packages/techniques: 
Spend a bit more time on any parts that you found particularly interesting or exciting. Were there packages you used that were helpful that we haven’t talked about in class? Did you find out how to do anything that you think other students could use in the future? Did you end up writing a lot of functions to use? Did you have an interesting way of sharing code and data among your group members?





# Lessons learned: 
If you were to do this project again from scratch, what would you do differently? Were there any big wrong turns along the way? Did you find out how to do something late in the project that would have saved you time if you’d started using it earlier?
